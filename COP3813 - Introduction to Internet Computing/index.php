				<h4>Welcome to What The Tutor</h4>
				<p>What The Tutor website is a portal for all Florida Atlantic University students to find tutoring service from other fellow students. We are organic website build by students and for students where you can find only local, FAU accredited students willing to help you. We connect students willing to provide services with ones that need them. All monetary transactions are between both parties without our envolvement. We simply want you to find the best tutor you can by screening our posters for their credentials and review score. We don't want you to get bad service by someone we recommend and we also don't want private companies that would charge more to use this service. Beyond getting tutoring help you will also build connections with fellow students. As you may need help with one educational subject, someone else may find your help useful in other areas. Here you will be able to do both. We ask all our tutors to prove their knowledge of material before they can post any advertisements. So find someone that can help you get further!</p>

				<h4>Student Reviews</h4>
				<p>Besides the verification of tutors, you can also see how good the tutor is by looking up his reviews. Once you setup appointment with the tutor, you will be able to evaluate his performance with other students. Reviews are another helpful way to see if tutor is helpful as his grades and knowledge may not always translate to ability of explaining those ideas in understandable way by others.</p>
